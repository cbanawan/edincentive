<p><strong>Use of Site:</strong> By participating on The Website (i.e., by completing the 

registration process), The User is stating that they are eligible to become a member and be 

bound by all of the Terms and Conditions of this agreement. </p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Use of Web Pages and Surveys:</strong> Use of The Website is strictly for 

personal, non­commercial purposes. The Company reserves the right to change, modify, or 

eliminate, and/or restrict or block access to, all or any part of The Website, without notice, at any 

time and from time­to­time. The User agrees that the The Company makes no guarantee to the 

availability or access to The Website and its service(s). The User may use The Website only 

when available.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Unauthorized use</h2>

<p>The User agrees to keep their password and other information confidential to prevent 

unauthorized use of their membership account.  It is also their responsibility to notify The 

Company of any improper uses of the account. Users are solely responsible for any loss of 

points or other fraudulent activities associated with password sharing.</p>

<br/>

<h2>User Content</h2>

<p>The User is solely liable and responsible for all content during participation of surveys and 

Personal Information they submit. User Content includes but is not limited to knowledge, 

materials, opinions, information, comments by The User, items uploaded, and digital information 

The User posts or submits in connection with The Website and/or during survey participation. 

The User is solely responsible for all third party approvals, consents, and/or authorizations 

required for user content.</p>

<br/>

<p>By using, uploading, posting, or submitting User Content in connection with The Website 

and/or during survey participation, The User hereby grants The Company a perpetual, 

irrevocable, unlimited, transferable, sub­licensable, worldwide, royalty­free right and license to 

edit, copy, transmit, publish, display, create derivative works of, reproduce, modify, distribute, 

and otherwise use the User Content provided.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>When registering, The User is creating an account on The Website. The User agrees that 

they will be sharing information such as name, address, age, and other Personal Information 

with The Company and Partners of The Company that send survey invitations.  Personal 

Information will be used according to The Company's Privacy Policy and Partners Privacy 

Policies. The User agrees to use a unique password for their membership account on The 

Website.  The User is responsible for any loss of points due to weak passwords or common 

passwords shared between The User’s personal accounts. The Company strongly suggests that 

The User does not use financial account numbers, government issued identification numbers, or 

other forms of identification as/in The User’s usernames or passwords.</p>

<br/>

<p>By registering on The Website, The User is registering with other market research 

companies "Partners" who deliver survey invitations. Our Partners conduct consumer research 

surveys and provides intuitive panel management solutions. Profile information that The User 

submits the The Company is managed through an application programming interface with our 

Partners. Profile information The User submits and questions The User answers are shared 

between Partners and The Company. By providing this information, The User gives permission 

for Partners and The Company to store the information in their respective databases. Survey 

invitations are sent through and managed through the The Company's platform and often 

through Partners survey platforms. Partners use the profile data that The User provides to 

match them to surveys.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Participation</h2>

<p><strong>Website Participation:</strong> The Website offers survey opportunities for The 

User to answer questions and voice their opinions on a variety of topics. The Company does not 

guarantee that The User will qualify to respond to surveys and earn rewards. The Company is 

not liable in any way if The User is unable to participate in The Website’s Rewards Program. 

The Company is not responsible for damages or losses that result from participating or inability 

to participate in The Website’s Rewards Program, or reliance on or use of information, services, 

or merchandise provided on or through The Website.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Survey Participation:</strong> The Website provides The User with the opportunity 

to participate in surveys.  By signing up, The User agrees to participate in surveys on The 

Website and receive communication from The Company and its Partners via email at the email 

address they provide. </p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Information for Survey Targeting:</strong>  The User agrees that profiles and 

surveys will ask information about The User to help target surveys specifically to them. From 

time to time, The User will be asked the same or similar questions to target surveys so The 

Company or its Partners can send The User surveys they will more likely qualify. The Company 

may monitor the consistency of The User’s answers to determine if they are being honest with 

the answers they provide.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Rewards Program</h2>

<p>The Website’s Rewards Program can include entries into sweepstakes, instant win chances, 

and earning survey points. The User may view their current point totals by logging into their 

account on The Website. Although The Company will make every effort to ensure The User’s 

account is credited correctly, it is The User’s responsibility to verify points have been credited 

properly. If The User feels their account balance is not correct, they should notify The Company 

about any discrepancies.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Earning Rewards:</strong> The reward being offered for a survey will be displayed 

on each survey invitation or on the opening page to the survey. Generally, The User will be 

offered and awarded an entry into a sweepstakes, instant win opportunities, a donation to 

charity, donations to local benefactors, or survey points as a reward for each survey The User 

qualifies for and complete. Determination of eligibility for the reward may be made at any time 

during the survey for reasons which may include, but are not necessarily limited to 

demographics, inconsistent responses, overly hurried responses, or other reasons. Some 

surveys offered by The Company are hosted by unaffiliated partners. In such cases, the 

decision to award The User lies solely within the discretion of the partner(s), and such decisions 

are final. The reward earned will usually be credited to The User’s account (as long as The 

User’s account is still active on The Website) generally a few minutes after completion of a 

survey, winning a sweepstakes drawing, or winning an instant win game. However, some 

surveys may require follow­ups or have other specifications that require The Company to delay 

crediting the reward to The User’s account for up to 4­8 weeks after the survey finishes. The 

User agrees that The Company, through any of its Website(s) or offerings, is under no 

obligation to provide Users with any particular number of Point­earning opportunities or send 

messages to them.</p>

<br/>

<p>The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer or conduct contests/sweepstakes or other 

incentives on certain surveys. For such surveys, the Terms and Conditions Agreement for the 

rewards programs and sweepstakes are located on each applicable web page, and specific 

rewards and sweepstakes Terms and Conditions Agreement may be included in survey 

invitations. The Company may engage a third party or third parties to administer rewards 

programs and sweepstakes. </p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Reward (Point) Value:</strong> Points earned on The Website may only be 

redeemed or spent as The Website authorizes. Points are currently redeemable for a value of 

100 points to one US dollar (100 points = $1.00). The Company reserves the right to modify or 

change this value at any time without notice. Points are not transferable nor are they considered 

to be property and therefore cannot be sold, transferred, or assigned to another User or 

individual under any circumstances.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Reward Expiration:</strong> As long as The User is an active member of The 

Website and in good standing, The User’s points will not expire. Situations that may result in a 

revocation of points are actions that violate The Website’s User Agreement (multiple accounts 

per household, consistently false/poor data, etc.)  Active membership means The User has had 

some survey activity or has logged into The Website within the previous two years.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Reward Delay:</strong> The User agrees that in some cases, there may be a 

delay in the reward posting on The User’s account for promotions of advertisers or partners due 

to advertisers' or partners' failure to provide necessary information to The Company. The 

Company will not be responsible or liable for the delay or failure to credit the reward in such an 

event. </p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Reward Adjustment:</strong> The User agrees that The Company reserves the 

right to adjust The User’s account reward balance with award reversals if The User provides any 

information that is untrue, inaccurate, inconsistent, incomplete, if there are problems due to 

accidental points awarded to The User, or for items related to fraudulent activities. </p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Non­Transferability:</strong> Membership on The Website is specific to The User 

who registered and completed the demographic information. Points and any other rewards or 

incentives are awarded to The User and are not transferable. Points are not considered to be 

property and therefore cannot be sold, bartered, transferred, or assigned to another member or 

individual under any circumstances.  The User’s account and points are not transferable upon 

death or as part of a domestic relations matter or otherwise by operation of law.</p>

<br/>

<p>The User understands that The Company reserves the right to change the survey rewards 

program at any time.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Redeeming Rewards</h2>

<p><strong>Redeeming Rewards:</strong> Points may be redeemed for various options at the 

sole discretion of The Company. The User must have earned the minimum number of points 

indicated, which varies according to the option. If The User elects to direct redemption rewards 

to their personal account and The User’s total redemptions for the calendar year is $600 or 

more, The Company will require US residents to provide tax information, such as name and 

social security number, before the payment is processed.  The Company will provide The User 

a Transaction History at the end of each year. The User can use that Transaction History to 

consult with a tax advisor to determine what amount of The User’s rewards can be deducted 

from their personal taxes. As stated above, survey points may not be combined or moved to 

another User account.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Tax Liability:</strong>EdIncentive does not provide any legal or tax advice to 

members of the website. Each member is solely liable and responsible for their own tax and 

legal obligations. EdIncentive may provide you and/or the appropriate government agency or 

taxing authority with information related to your Rewards redemption and donation history and, if 

applicable, EdIncentive may withhold taxes upon request from the appropriate government 

agency or taxing authority. You acknowledge that EdIncentive may be required to provide or 

supply certain information to applicable government agencies or departments in regards to any 

payments or incentives you earn in connection with your use of EdIncentive’s services. You 

agree to provide EdIncentive with all required information to assist EdIncentive in complying 

with its reporting or withholding obligations.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Redeeming Limits:</strong> The User agrees that The Website has reward 

redeeming limits. Reward redeeming limits and minimums may be modified from User to User 

based on the tenure and credibility. The User may gain credibility with consistent and honest 

answers. Reward redeeming limits will be displayed in the Redeem section of the membership 

area when logged in.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Redeeming Delay:</strong> The User agrees that there may be delay to redeem 

rewards due to their account status as The Company evaluates The User’s account and 

answers to surveys that The User provided to look for consistencies and fraudulent activity. The 

reward redemption can be blocked and/or canceled if The Company finds that The User 

provided any information that is untrue, inaccurate, inconsistent, incomplete, or problems due to 

accidental points awarded to The User, or for items related to fraudulent activities. </p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Un­redeemed Checks:</strong> Checks are valid for 90 days after issue date. In 

the event that the recipient of the check fails to deposit/cash a check issued by The Company 

within that time period, The Company may, at its sole discretion and upon an email notification 

to The User, void the issued check and restore the check amount to The User’s balance by way 

of points.</p>

<br/>

<p>The User agrees that once a redemption is made and The Company has paid the reward, 

The Company is no longer liable for the funds.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Updating Personal Information</h2>

<p>It is The User’s sole responsibility to promptly notify The Company of any changes in 

personal and other information, including but not limited to name, physical address, mailing 

address, phone number, email address, and demographic information by updating such 

information on The Website. To update this information, The User agrees to log into their 

account and update their profiles.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Third Party Websites and Links</h2>

<p>Surveys and Survey invitations offered to The User on The Site may contain links to 

websites or content not controlled by The Company. The User agrees that The Company is not 

responsible or liable for any Third Party Websites or any Third Party Content. The Company 

makes no representations or warranties whatsoever about any Third Party Websites or Third 

Party Content.</p>

<br/>

receive newsletter emails that provide information on new features, contests, or general 

announcements.  The User may opt out of receiving newsletters by clicking the unsubscribe 

button or link contained within the newsletter and following the instructions or prompts.  The 

User may also opt out from newsletter emails in their account settings, if that option is

<br/>

<p><strong>Emails:</strong> The User agrees to maintain a valid email address that can

that each email received will be answered. </p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Critical Notifications:</strong> The Company reserves the right to send The User 

messages from time to time, for which they may not be rewarded. Such messages may include, 

but are not limited to, system updates critical to their membership.  Members cannot 

unsubscribe from these Administrative Messages while they are registered, unless they 

unsubscribe/opt out from The Website entirely.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Fraudulent Activity</h2> 

<p><strong>Honest and Accurate Disclosures:</strong> As a User of The Website, The User 

agrees to provide true and accurate information during the registration process, while filling out 

demographic profile information and other general details, and while answering survey research 

questionnaires. The User agrees to not mask or forge their true identity.  If The Website has 

reason to believe The User has provided any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, 

inconsistent, or incomplete to The Website or one of its partners, The Website has the right to 

immediately terminate The User’s membership and/or refuse any and all current or future

surveys.</p>

<br/>
